Flip-flops or Socks

Flip-flops or Socks is a social media app that uses the NOAA API to get local weather, and lets the user know whether flips-flops are appropriate for the current weather conditions.

The app also references a list of preferred brands or advertisers that it can pull from to make clothing suggestions for the user based on current weather conditions.

The user is also suggested to take and upload a photo of their current outfit.  The photo is analyzed using AI fashion recognition API to determine clothing that the user owns, helping to personalize the advertised brands.
